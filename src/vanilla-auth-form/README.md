## Install

```
$ git clone git git@github.com:albertmolodec/vanilla-auth-form.git
$ cd vanilla-auth-form
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

## Tech

Vanilla JS, CSS with a little postcss syntax sugar, e.g. nesting (which can easily be replaced).

There is a responsive layout with using of CSS Grid, Flex, custom-properties and some mixins magic.

Deployed to [now](https://vanilla-auth-form.albertmolodec.now.sh) with help of [serve utility](https://github.com/zeit/serve).
